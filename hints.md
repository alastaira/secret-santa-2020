## The Final Gift
<details>
  <summary>Hint #1</summary>
  You should have nine words as the solutions to the nine puzzles above. Write them next to the appropriate person, and then consider the comments as to how they need to be changed.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Hint #2</summary>
  Every answer needs to have "a little character" added to it. In this case, a little character = a single letter
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Hint #3</summary>
  For example, the answer to the Jeweller's Puzzle was ETERNAL. What letter could you add to that word to make it mean more "outside"?
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Hint #4</summary>
  If you add an X to ETERNAL, you get EXTERNAL. Now try to find other letters that can be inserted into the other answer words to fit the clues.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Solution - MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT!</summary>
 - X + eternal = external
 - M + pasties = pastimes
 - A + briny = brainy
 - S + needles = needless
 - C + aid = acid
 - H + peasants = pheasants
 - E + on-time = one-time
 - E + plants = planets
