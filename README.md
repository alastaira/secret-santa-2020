# secret-santa-2020
This repository contains details of a mystery puzzle game created as a Secret Santa gift given in Christmas 2020.

## Background
The Secret Santa was arranged within a Facebook group of puzzle game enthusiasts from around the world. Games could be created on any theme, and use any variety of media - physical, digital, or experiential. They could be narrative-focussed, or puzzle-focussed. They were then sent to your nominated receipient.
I wanted to create a light-hearted game, and I thought it was appropriate to make one that was loosely Christmas-themed. So, I went for a "Scrooge"-inspired story about a mean ruler who, despite wanting for nothing, felt no joy. Each puzzle would be themed around a different gift which one of her subjects made her, and the final metapuzzle would involve extracting parts from each of the individual puzzle solutions to create the *ultimate* Christmas gift.

I felt that this provided enough scaffolding for the game - it provided some thematic context, an objective and motivation for the player, and plenty of opportunities to integrate different puzzle types. Since storytelling is not my strongest skill, I thought I could make up for it somewhat my writing all the text in rhyming verse, as in a children's fairytale.

If you are one of the two people in the world who have received a copy of the game, you can find some hints below, as well as some galleries of how the puzzles were constructed.

  <summary>Hint #2</summary>
  Line up the rings next to each other in the correct order. If the rings are too small for your fingers, perhaps try stacking them on a pencil.

  You may need to flip some of the rings around - do the symbols resemble letters?
